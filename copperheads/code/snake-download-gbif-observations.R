#hey, this is excluding all snake observations that haven't been identified to family. Think about if that's a good way to do this - I think we could assume that unidentified snakes are not copperheads, and boost the power of saying how many snakes were observed? But also, these are all the research grade observations, so they MUST have been identified further. Anyway, this why there's a difference between the number of records available on iNat (500k) vs the number downloaded from gbif (300 something k)
