Question of interest (data framing)
To what degree the emergence of a periodical cicada brood influences copperhead activity and population, calculated as the percent of iNat snake observations that are eastern copperheads. Similar to the paper 'Periodical Cicada Emergences Affect Masting Behavior of Oaks' want to conduct a superimposed epoch analysis to see the results of periodical cicada emergence on these snakes.

Steps are as follows:

- download iNat data on all snake observations in all years within the range
of the eastern copperhead. For ease of download (although! note this may increase the processing time of the trimming step) could do all of North America
 quality_grade=research&identifications=any&captive=false&geoprivacy=open&iconic_taxa%5B%5D=Reptilia&swlat=30&swlng=-100&nelat=45&nelng=-70&taxon_id=85553&verifiable=true
 Downloaded from GBIF, then filtered to just snakes
 returns 500,000 observations
- download data on the location of periodicial cicada broods (might be available from Koenig et al. 2023) (done)
- filter snake data to within the counties that have periodical cicada broods
- for both each county and each overall brood emergence area, get the proportion of all snake observations that are copperheads in each year
- probably ought to filter to only after 2008 as this is when there are about a thousand snake observations a year, seems like a good minimum bound. If it needs to be moved up, 2013 is the first year over 100 copperheads were observed. 
- take a casual look at this data to see if there's anything interesting that looks like it might be going on
- run a superimposed epoch analysis - see oak tree paper for citations that reference it's use and how to run it
- graph and check out results
